            The exhibits are accompanied by rich audio-visual material (in Greek and English), such as explanatory labels and 
            giant posters with a lot of information, detailed diagrams, photos and complete bibliographical references, while 
            many of the exhibits are interactive. There are projecting stations with video and animation as well as 
            documentaries in which the exhibitor explains the function and the use of the mechanisms.
